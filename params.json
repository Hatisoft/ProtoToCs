Where the folders called protos will contain two sub-folder:\r\n* Raw: Contains the non compiled files (.proto files).\r\n* Compiled: Output folder of the compilation (.cs files).\r\n\r\nIf you are using NGet for the dependencies of your project  I would recommend to use the tools that are distributed with the package [gRPC Tools](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Tools/), in any other case during compilation you should provide the directory for two executables (protoc and grpc_csharp_plugin.exe).\r\n\r\nLast for not least the execution will require you to have install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\n###Run\r\n\r\nnode ProtoToCs.js `<ProjectFolder>` `<ToolsFolder>`\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n* `<ProjectFolder>`: Is the root of your project\r\n* `<ToolsFolder>`: Is the folder containing protoc and grpc_csharp_plugin executables.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-64624825-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
